# Penguin Weight Monitoring Project
## Overview
The Penguin Weight Monitoring Project is an IoT-based system designed to monitor the weight of African penguins using an ESP32 microcontroller, an RFID reader, and an ESP32-CAM module. The system detects penguins via RFID tags (assigned to named penguins like Billy, Sally, and Charlie) or weight changes on a scale, captures images, and sends the data (weight, condition, location, and image) to a Node.js server for storage in a MongoDB database. The project aims to track penguin health by analyzing weight trends and associating them with specific locations.

## Key Features

- RFID Tag Detection: Identifies penguins (Billy, Sally, Charlie) by their RFID tags and records their weight immediately.
- Weight Averaging: Averages weight readings when a penguin (tagged or untagged) is on the scale, sending the average when they leave.
- Location Assignment: Assigns locations based on nickname (e.g., Billy at Boulders Beach, Sally at Stony Point, Charlie at Robben Island).
- Image Capture: Uses ESP32-CAM to take photos when weight changes are detected or tags are read.
- Data Transmission: Sends JSON data to a remote server via HTTP POST.
- Weight Filtering: Ignores unrealistic weight readings (> 5 kg) to handle scale errors.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board: Main controller (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32).
- ESP32-CAM Module: For image capture.
- RFID Reader: Connected via UART (e.g., MFRC522 or similar, configured for 9600 baud).
- Load Cell/Scale: Connected to provide weight data via UDP.
- Wires and Power Supply: For connecting components.

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE: For programming the ESP32 (with ESP32 board support installed).
- Libraries:
  - WiFi.h
  - WiFiUdp.h
  - esp_wpa2.h
  - HTTPClient.h
  - ArduinoJson.h
  - base64.h


- Node.js Server: Running at http://196.24.134.8:3000/api/weight with MongoDB for data storage.
- Wi-Fi Network: Eduroam (or similar WPA2-Enterprise network) with valid credentials.

# Setup Instructions
1. Hardware Setup

- Connect the RFID reader to the ESP32:
  - TXD1 to GPIO 19
  - RXD1 to GPIO 21

- Connect the ESP32-CAM to the ESP32:
  - CAM_TXD to GPIO 17
  - CAM_RXD to GPIO 16


- Connect the load cell/scale to send weight data via UDP to port 12345.
- Power all components and ensure stable connections.

2. Software Configuration

- Install the Arduino IDE and add ESP32 board support via the Boards Manager.
- Install the required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager.
- Open linking.ino in the Arduino IDE.
- Update the following credentials in the code:
  - ssid: Set to "eduroam" (or your Wi-Fi network name).
  - username: Replace with your Eduroam username (e.g., username@wf.uct.ac.za).
  - password: Replace with your Eduroam password.
  - serverUrl: Ensure it points to your Node.js server (default: http://196.24.134.8:3000/api/weight).


- Update the tagMap array in the code if you have different RFID tags or nicknames.

3. Upload and Run

- Select your ESP32 board and port in the Arduino IDE.
- Upload the code to the ESP32.
- Open the Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to view debug output.
- Ensure the ESP32-CAM and RFID reader are powered and communicating.

4. Server Setup

- Set up a Node.js server with an endpoint (/api/weight) to receive POST requests and store data in MongoDB.
- The server should expect JSON data with fields: penguin_id, measurements (array with date, weight, condition, location), and image (base64-encoded).

# Usage

- With RFID Tag: Place a tagged penguin on the scale. The system will detect the tag, record the current weight, take a photo, and send the data to the server with the assigned location.
- Without RFID Tag: If a significant weight change (1.5â€“5 kg) is detected, the system will average weights until the weight drops below 1.5 kg, then send the average with the default location ("Boulders Beach") or the last known nickname's location.
- Monitoring: Check the Serial Monitor for real-time updates and the MongoDB database for stored data.
